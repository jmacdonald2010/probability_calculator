Code still does not pass test. Unsure of errors. Going to keep trying things, not entirely sure what. This commit is really just a backup save in case I really mess things up.

Running into list index out of range errors in my draw function, and when i don't have those, i get stuck in a loop. Need to solve this issue. Pushing to remote before getting ready for work.

Finished writing the code, needs some fixing. In the test, the program seems to get stuck, and I'm not entirely sure why. I also need to make it so that the draw method reduces the contents in the contents list. Pushing prior to working on those things in case of error.

Still working on finishing the code. Have not tested anything yet. Pushing to remote before going to bed.

Projected started. Still building the experiment function. Nothing has been tested yet. Pushing to remote before going to work.
